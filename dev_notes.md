# Chess Engine UI

List of components:
* Chess board *(under development)*
* Clock, ...

## Anatomy of chess board component

**BACKLOG**: implement pieces, moves, uci output

**Task 1**: ~~recognize name of the square clicked (i.e A1, C7..)~~<br>
**Task 2**: ~~implement moves~~<br>
**Task 3**: render piece per square

## Thoughts
piece-rendering-board -> as it should works!<br>
piece-rendering-component -> image get buried under rect<br>
piece-rendering-component-attribute -> same as piece-rendering-component...not worth following this approach<br>
piece-rendering-directive -> not works at all, imageUrl can not be set from a directive<br>
